👋 Hello! I'm Guillaume, a passionate 4th-year computer science student from France 🇫🇷. With a **strong foundation in software engineering**, I've cultivated a deep interest in a wide array of fields within the world of computer science.

🚀 **My primary focus is on software engineering**, where I've honed my skills over the past 9 years. I'm well-versed in the art of **modern C++**, and I've delved into the intricacies of C, Rust, Java, Python, and Javascript/Typescript. I also have experience with functional programming using OCaml, and I'm adept at front-end development, mainly with the Vue.js framework.

🌐 **I love exploring new horizons in programming**, whether it's tackling low-level programming, diving into compiler implementation, exploring the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, or crafting solutions for distributed systems. I thrive on the challenge of learning and mastering new domains.

🔧 Currently, I'm actively working on some exciting projects:
- **Wxllpulse**: A video wallpaper setter for the X11 window manager, written in C++17. It's my passion project where I'm pushing the boundaries of what's possible with X11 and creating stunning visual experiences.
- **LoraDatasetManager**: A powerful tool for managing image datasets, crafted with Rust (using Tauri) and Typescript (using Vue.js). This project combines my love for Rust's performance and Vue.js's user-friendly interface, making dataset management a breeze.

👋 Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you have any questions or exciting projects in mind !
