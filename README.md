Hi, I'm Guillaume ! I'm a french IT student, and a C++ enthusiast. I'm currently interested in system programming, executable and libraries file formats, lexers, parsers & co, and sometimes desktop application programming.
I can work with C, C++, x86_64 ASM, Java, C#, Python and Go. (Maybe Rust in a near future?)
